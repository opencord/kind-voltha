# DEPRECATED

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

`VOLTHA 2.7` was the last release that officially supported `kind-voltha` as a deployment tool.
From now on the deployment is driven via helm charts, please refer to [voltha-helm-charts](https://github.com/opencord/voltha-helm-charts) and [voltha-docs](docs.voltha.org) for more information.
This codebase is going to be removed after the VOLTHA 2.8 release LTS support ends in December 2022.

#  VOLTHA DEPLOYMENT TOOL
Thie repository describes how to the the `voltha` script to install a
VOLTHA deployment. `voltha` can be used to deploy an instance into an existing
Kubernetes cluster (physical or virtual) or can be start up a local
docker-in-docker KinD Kuberentes cluster in which to deploy VOLTHA.

When deploying VOLTHA there are several configuration options tha can be
set as described in the [*CONFIGURATION*](#configuration) section below. All configuration
options are specified as envirment variables.

## PREREQUISITES
The `voltha` script uses several standard Linux tools to deploy VOLTHA
including `curl`, `sed`, and `jq`. This tools must be installed before
using the script. The script checks for the presence of these tools before
it deployes VOLTHA and will exit with an error if the tools are not present.

_NOTE: If you are deploying a KinD Kubernetes cluster using the `voltha`
script, you must also also have Docker installed_

## NAMING YOUR CLUSTER

The `voltha` script can be used to manage multiple clusters at the same time,
thus it's important to always name your cluster.

```bash
export NAME=minimal
```

Throughout this `README.md` file you'll find multiple references to `$NAME`
and that can always be replaced with the name your cluster (the default value is `local`).

## TL;DR
OK, if you really don't care how it starts and you just want it started. After
cloning the repository and making sure you have the prerequisites installed,
just execute
```bash
DEPLOY_K8S=y WITH_BBSIM=y WITH_RADIUS=y CONFIG_SADIS=y ./voltha up
```
and the minimal cluster should start.

To remove voltha use `DEPLOY_K8S=y ./voltha down`

## RUN WITHOUT CLONING REPOSITORY
The `voltha` script can be run without cloning the complete repository. To do
so, download the script and run it.
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencord/kind-voltha/master/voltha --output ./voltha
chmod +x ./voltha
DEPLOY_K8S=y WITH_BBSIM=y WITH_RADIUS=y CONFIG_SADIS=y ./voltha up
```

![Demo @ Speed](./resources/kind-voltha.gif "Demo @ Speed")
_NOTE: Shown significantly sped up (20x), actual install was about 8 minutes._

## CONFIGURATION
The option should be set using environment variables, thus to start VOLTHA
with the BBSIM POD, RADIUS, EFK and ONOS SADIS configured  you could use the
following command:
```bash
WITH_BBSIM=yes WITH_RADIUS=y WITH_EFK=y CONFIG_SADIS=y  voltha up
```

To start a specific version of VOLTHA, e.g. 2.5, you could use the following commands:
```bash
source releases/voltha-2.5 && voltha up
```
Please check the `releases` folder to see the available ones and pick the correct tag associatet do that release.

### Managing the cluster(s) size
The `voltha` script supports configuration for cluster of different sizes.
For example you can setup an HA cluster with:

```bash
NUM_OF_WORKER_NODES=3 NUM_OF_ONOS=3 NUM_OF_KAFKA=3 NUM_OF_ETCD=3 NUM_OF_ATOMIX=3 ./voltha up
```
As usual one can add as many other options, for example `CONFIG_SADIS=y`.

### Custom Namespaces

Separate namespaces can be specified for various components
  - `VOLTHA_NS`  (default: `voltha`)  for cores, ofagent, Etcd (yes), Kafka (yes)
  - `ADAPTER_NS` (default: `voltha`)  for device adapters
  - `INFRA_NS`   (default: `default`) for RADIUS, ONOS, Etcd (external), Kafka (external)
  - `BBSIM_NS`   (default: `voltha`)  for BBSIM instances

As an example `BBSIM_NS=devices` deployes BBSim in the `devices` namespace.

### External Kafka, Etcd and ONOS
`WITH_ETCD`,  `WITH_KAFKA` and `WITH_ONOS` can have different values depending on the deployment needs:

| VALUE            | DESCRIPTION |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `yes` or `y`     | installs Etcd and Kafka in the `voltha` namespace |
| `external`       | installs Etcd and Kafka in the `default` namespace |
| `<endpoint>`     | connects the deployment to pre-deployed instance of the service |

When specifying the `<endpoint>` of the service the format for each of these is `service-name`[`:port`]. Port is optional and will default to the standard port for the given service. For example, `WITH_KAFA=kafka.infra.svc.cluster.local`

Specifying the endpoint enable to use `./voltha up` incrementally, for example:
```
DEPLOY_K8S=n WITH_BBSIM=y WITH_RADIUS=no CONFIG_SADIS=no  WITH_ONOS=onos-openflow.infra.svc.cluster.local  WITH_ETCD=etcd-cluster-client.infra.svc.cluster.local WITH_KAFKA=kafka.infra.svc.cluster.local  INFRA_NS=infra BBSIM_NS=devices ADAPTER_NS=adapters ./voltha up
```
starts VOLTHA with external ONOS,KAFKA,ETCD in the `infra` namespace.

### `CONFIG_SADIS` Values

| VALUE            | DESCRIPTION |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `yes` or `file`  | use the contents of a file to configure SADIS in ONOS. The file used defaults to<br>`onos-files/onos-sadis-sample.json` but can be specified via the `SADIS_CFG`<br>environment variable |
| `no`             | do not configure ONOS for SADIS usage |
| `url`            | configure ONOS to use SADIS via a URL. The URL used for subscriber information<br> is specified in the variable `SADIS_SUBSCRIBERS` and the URL used for bandwidth<br> profiles is specified in the variable `SADIS_BANDWIDTH_PROFILES` |
| `bbsim`          | configure ONOS use use the SADIS servers that are part of BBSIM |
| `external`       | an additional helm chart will be installed (`bbsim-sadis-server`) and ONOS will be configured to use that service for SADIS queries |

### `BBSIM_CFG` Values

`BBSIM_CFG` contains a description of the services that is needed to properly configure BBSim.
Examples are available in the `configs` folder. It can be pointed to any valid BBSim service configuration.

You'll note that the examples contain a `:TAG:` placeholder. That is used by `kind-voltha`
to generate different `C/S_TAG` combinations when deploying multiple instances of BBSim and it's
replaced with an incremental number starting from `900`.

### EFK Configuration for accessing Voltha component logs
If EFK is selected for deployment with VOLTHA, `WITH_EFK=yes`, then a single node elasticsearch and kibana
instance will be deployed and a fluentd-elasticsearch pod will be deployed on each node that allows workloads
to be scheduled.

Additionally a port-forward will be established so that you can access elasticsearch(`9200`) and kibana(`5601`)
from outside the Kubernetes cluster. To access the kibana web interface user the URL `http://localhost:5601`.

_NOTE: By default the security and physical persistance(disk) features are not enabled for elasticsearch and kibana.
The security features can be enabled via X-Pack plugin and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in Elasticsearch by adding
the required settings in yaml file. To enable security features reference the following links:_
[EFK-Setup-With-Kind-Voltha](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KF1HhE-PN-VY4JN2bqKmQBrZghFC5HQM_s0mC0slapA/edit#)
[elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-security.html)
[kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/rest-apis.html)

When running an EFK stack in production there are several maintenance that need to be periodically performed
including indexes triming. When planning to deploy an EFK stack to production you should fully understand
the recommendations as described in the product documenation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html

### Jaeger Tracing Stack for analyzing Voltha Component Traces
If Tracing is selected for deployment with VOLTHA using `WITH_TRACING=yes` option, then a single Jaeger
all-in-one instance will be deployed using Memory as Storage backend for traces sent by Voltha conatiners.

Additionally a port-forward will be established so that you can access Jaeger GUI(`16686`) from outside the
 Kubernetes cluster using URL `http://localhost:16686`.

### Controlling VOLTHA with an ONOS cluster

To provide HA, resilinecy and failover ONOS can be configured in cluster mode.
A 3 node ONOS deployment for example can be achieved via:
```bash
NUM_OF_WORKER_NODES=3 WITH_ONOS=classic NUM_OF_ONOS=3 NUM_OF_ATOMIX=3 ./voltha up
```
Please note the above command deploys a 3 worker nodes for k8s and `WITH_ONOS=classic` that uses the
cluster-enabled [helm chart](https://charts.onosproject.org) for ONOS (version 2.2).
The `NUM_OF_ONOS=3 NUM_OF_ATOMIX=3` flags set the number of Atomix nodes and ONOS nodes.

As usual one can add as many other options, for example `CONFIG_SADIS=y`.

## GENERATED CONFIGURATION
When the voltha script is run it generates a file that contains the
configuration settings. This file will be named `$NAME-env.sh`. The user can
`source` this file to set the configuration as well as establish key environment
variables in order to access VOLTHA, including:

| VARIABLE   | DESCRIPTION |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| KUBECONFIG | Sets the configuration file for the Kubernetes control application `kubectl` |
| VOLTCONFIG | Sets the configuration file for the VOLTHA control application `voltctl` |
| PATH       | Augments the `PATH` to include `kubectl` and `voltctl` |

After `voltha up` is run, it is useful to source this file.

## QUICK CHECK
After source the `$NAME-env.sh` file, you should be able to access VOLTHA via
the control application `voltctl`. To validate this you can use the following
command
```bash
voltctl version
```
and should see output similar to
```
Client:
 Version        1.0.14
 Go version:    go1.12.8
 Vcs reference: 086629f0403fe67213fa0df5dc4d7b7ee317cbac
 Vcs dirty:     false
 Built:         2020-03-03T13:48:00Z
 OS/Arch:       linux/amd64

Cluster:
 Version        2.3.3-dev
 Go version:    1.13.8
 Vcs feference: aa8bd4dcc3510caf2c5362106d9bff2852663d31
 Vcs dirty:     false
 Built:         2020-03-06T16:16:47Z
 OS/Arch:       linux/amd64
```

If you've run the voltha script with `WITH_BBSIM=y` you can now create a BBSIM OLT with
```bash
voltctl device create -t openolt -H bbsim0.voltha.svc:50060
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING
When VOLTHA is installed the install log is written to the file
`install-$NAME.log`. If the install appears stalled or is not completing
consulting this file may indicate the reason.

Similarly, when VOLTHA is uninstalled `down-$NAME.log` is written and should
be consulted in the event of an error or unexpected result.
